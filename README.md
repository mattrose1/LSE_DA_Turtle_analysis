# LSE_DA_Turtle_analysis


Initial Analysis using Linear regression of the turtle data shows that there is clear linear relationships between loyalty points, spending score and salary, however there is probably deeper analysis needed by implementing multiple linear regression to show even further trend analysis between the columns. Interestingly there was no linear relationship between loyalty points and age. Again this would be useful to use as a independent variable in the muliple linear regression to see if it has any influence on the model when coupled with other independent variables.
When plotting the datapoints and the regression line on each model, it is interesting how the higher that the data moved in the independent variable, the more erratic the data becomes with values showing both below and above the trend line. Ideally a further data cleanse would be performed to remove any outliers outside of the IQR which may drive a more accurate model and trend line.
